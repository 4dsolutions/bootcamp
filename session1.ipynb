    "## General Information\n",
    "\n",
    "Python was designed by Guido van Rossum for a technical audience already well-versed in computer skills.  Unlike BASIC, which was designed as a \"teaching language\".  However, Python is elegant and expressive enough to attract beginners and professionals alike.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python was originally named for the British comedy troupe Monty Python.  References to Monty Python are scattered throughout the documentation.  For example IDLE, the IDE that comes with Python, is a pun on Eric Idle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rich, yet inexpensive (as in mostly free), ecosystem surrounding Python attracts the best and brightest from many walks of life, who then freely contribute, thereby adding yet more value to our Python World.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every computer language has its pedigree and story.  Python's story includes the great leap forward from 2.x to 3.x, breaking backward compatibility, at a time when Python was already popular within industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter Project is one of those value-adding 3rd party tools that brings people flocking to Python. It grew out of the I-Python project, which includes the I-Python console and its \"magics\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\"3rd party\" means \"not part of the Standard Library\".  The [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/) is a catalog of freely available 3rd party projects."

    "* Through the Command Line:  Enter `python` on the command line to boot into a Python shell (REPL).  Alternatively, enter `python some_module.py` to run the module.\n",
    "* Through an IDE:  many interactive development environments are good for Python development.  Try them out!\n",
